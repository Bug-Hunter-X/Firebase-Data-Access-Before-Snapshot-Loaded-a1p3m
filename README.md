This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous operations and document snapshots. The bug occurs when attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded from Firebase.  The solution involves using promises or async/await to ensure the data is fully loaded before attempting to access it.  Check the provided JavaScript files for examples of the buggy code and its corrected version.
